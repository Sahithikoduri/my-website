	<p>What we find hardest is to define what a "music lover" is. The basic meaning of "music lover" is quite clear, but it gets complicated when we try to differentiate between those for whom a love of music goes beyond a good collection of vinyls.

Just to clarify, here are a series of essential characteristics. You only need meet one of these conditions to be a licensed music lover and get a warm welcome on our social networks:

You are a music lover if there are songs that give you goosebumps.
You are a music lover if you sing at the top of your voice in the car.
You are a music lover if you give concerts in the shower.
You are a music lover if live music makes your heart beat faster.
You are a music lover if you dance without realising it.
You are a music lover if you sing in English without being able to speak English.
You are a music lover if you feel there are songs written just for you.
You are a music lover if a song broke your heart one day but mended it the next.
You are a music lover if you like to live accompanied by a soundtrack.

	<h2 style="color:blue;">my favourite cartoon-Doraemon</h2>
	<p>Doraemon's physical appearance changed as the manga progressed. At first, he was predominantly kingfish color, with a blue tail, a white stomach, and flesh-colored hands and feet. He also stooped, and had a body much larger than his head. In later issues, he sported a smaller body, white hands and feet, and a red tail — the appearance most identified with him today. In the 1995 short film 2112: The Birth of Doraemon (as well as The Doraemons story arc set in the Robot School), it is revealed that Doraemon's original paint color was yellow, and had a more high-pitched voice than his current counterpart. After getting his ears gnawed off by a robot mouse at the 22nd century Nobi's residence, he slipped into depression on top of a tower, where he erroneously drank a potion labeled "sadness" instead of "happiness". As he wept, the yellow color washed off and his voice changed due to the potion. As a result, he developed a morbid fear of mice despite being a robotic cat. Doraemon often becomes enraged when he is mistaken for a raccoon dog due to his missing ears, which is a running gag in the series.

Doraemon is considered a substandard product because many of his robotic features (i.e. radar whiskers and cat-calling bell) malfunctioned after production due to an accident in the factory while he was being built. Due to this malfunction, Doraemon did not do well at the robot's school and during the final presentation show, he performed badly and nobody wanted to hire him, until baby Sewashi pushed the button. His parents were a bit reluctant, but since Sewashi liked him, they hired Doraemon, and he took care of him until Sewashi himself sent him to the past to take care of Nobita. Despite this, Doraemon shows a lot of intelligence and common sense. Whenever he hangs out with his friend, Mii-Chan (a cute street cat), he calls it 'important work' as an excuse for not doing chores that Nobita's mother asks him to do. As a robot, Doraemon can be programmed to complete a task by pushing a button on his nose, and can even shut down if his tail is pulled. In a few episodes, Doraemon has been shown to be in danger of factory-resting,[8] or being on the verge of breaking.

Doraemon's favourite food is dorayaki (どら焼き) (known as "fudgy pudgy pie" in the first revision of the English manga, although it has since been reverted back to "dorayaki", "yummy buns" in the English dub, and "dora-cakes/bean jam buns" in other versions), a Japanese treat filled with red bean paste. While it might explain the origin of his name, it was revealed in one of the manga chapters that his name originates from the Japanese word nora neko (のら猫) for "stray cat", and the -emon (衛門) ending which is part of traditional Japanese names, as seen also in, for example, Ishikawa Goemon.[9][10][11]</p>
